Run ./calibrator <input device> as root and click on all rounds.

After you have clicked on the last the calibration program
writes to the output calibration parameters wich have to be merged into "XF86Config-4". 
Open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and merge these lines into the "InputDevice"-section of your
touchscreen.

That's it.
