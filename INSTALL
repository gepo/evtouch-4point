This file is intended to provide a little description to compile and install 
from source. The installation instructions for the binary tarballs can be found
on the web-page http://www.conan.de/lifebook/lifebook-2.6.html.

To compile the driver from source, please make sure you have the source for
your current XFree86 Server installed.

One way to check which version of XFree86 you have installed is to check
the messages in /var/log/XFree86.<ScreenNum>.log.
This is also the file containing the debug messages if you #define EVDBG during
compilation. 

The easiest way to install the XFree86 sources is of course to use the source
packages that came with your Linux distribution.

After that it should be easy -- type:
xmkmf -a
make
su
make install


If this does not work get the source-tarballs from
ftp.xfree86.org. Unpack these tarballs.

Go to the driver sources-directory: 

xmkmf <your_xfree_source_top> `pwd`
make
su
make install


There are 2 defines which can be set to enable debugging output
1. DEBUG  --  enables normal debugging output
2. LOGRAW --  enables output of the raw 3-byte packets 

to build a driver with both options enabled do
make DEBUG=y LOGRAW=y


X.org 7.0 Install
-----------------
Part of the X.org 7.0 modulalization is that They started to 
use autotools. So you have have autotools (aclocal,autoconf,automake
libtool) installed in your system to compile with this option.

The are needed steps.
./autogen.sh --prefix=/path/to/your/X.org
make
make install

Have fun!
