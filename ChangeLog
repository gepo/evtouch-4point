0.8.7-HR *** Note this is not an official release but an "unauthorized
	 *** fix version by me (Harald Radke - harryrat@postnuklear.de)
	-> Changed code to compile a working driver for  both 
	  XInput ABI 0.x and 2.0 (Xorg 1.4.0)
	  (test compile for 0.x still needs to be done)
	  - evtouch.c: 
            * capsulated xf86Post*Events and xf86InputSetScreen 
	      in functions where depending on the XINPUT ABI conversion
	      is done or xf86 functions are directly called
	    * xf86InitValuatorAxisStruct and xf86AlwaysCore() depending
	      on ABI done
	  - libtouch.h: passing xf86PostButtonEvent capsulation function
	    to init function (same as in evtouch.c) to do proper button
	    triggering
	-> Rotation:
	  - added support for Option "Rotate" "UD" (upside down) 
	     in evtouch input section of xorg.conf
	  - due to Segfault with (at least) fbdev video device, only
	    evtouch "Rotate" option is taken into calculations for coords,
	    meaning to get proper touchscreen behaviour on rotated X screens.
	    same Rotate option as in video device section of xorg.conf has
            to be set in the evtouch section
	-> Drag support:
	  Option "<STATE>_drag" "<BUTTON_ID>" has been added. When set,
	  the handle_<STATE>() function triggers BUTTON_DOWN for Button <BUTTON_ID>
	  before changing into S_MOVE state. Note that actually only
	  Option "touched_drag" "<BUTTON_ID>" is implemented, rest is dummy
	  (and doesn't make too much sense I guess) (-;
	-> tap "tolerance":
	   introduce move_limit to evtouch.c as it is in libtouch.c, using it
	   to discard ABS_X/Y position changes if they are inside move_limit
	   around cur_x/y. this way pointer hopping can be avoided as well as
           proper touched_drag established
         - changes of cur_x/y are reported on EV_SYN in evtouch.c ReadInput() instead
           on EV_ABS
	-> added generic ts-adc touchscreen device to udev rules file	   

	=>  Example for a Loox720 PDA setup in input section of xorg.conf:
		Section "InputDevice"
		 Identifier "touchscreen"
		 Driver "evtouch"
		 Option "Device" "/dev/input/evtouch_event"
		 Option "MinX" "434"
		 Option "MinY" "333"
		 Option "MaxX" "3643"
		 Option "MaxY" "3804"
		 Option "SwapX" "true"
		 Option "longtouched_action" "down"
		 Option "longtouched_button" "3"
		 Option "maybetapped_action" "click"
		 Option "maybetapped_button" "1"
		 Option "touched_drag" "1"
		 Option "oneandahalftap_button" "0"
		 Option "TapTimer" "30"
		 Option "LongtouchTimer"  "500"
		 Option "MoveLimit"  "18"
		EndSection
